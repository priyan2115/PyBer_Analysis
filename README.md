# PyBer_Analysis

##**Summary**

This school_budget project plays an important role towards learning new skills with Pandas,we face some challanges too, but that challanges tought us so many things.

so,what I learn through this project is how the small detailing works and gave us the output we want, think beyond the cloud is more important when we create a quaries for gathering our output,some little and silly mistake can totally effected on our output so always work with focuse is the goal.

**DISCOVERIES**

I found that if the DataFrame is not Mention correctly that cause a big problem for the whole code because that is the keyfeature here,as well as importing right function and library is one of the most important thing.

As we can see in the Deleverable 5 question 2 we perform with student_id here but if we can perform with reading_score that gave us the same result too. note:- I submited the screenshot link in Readme.file on github.
