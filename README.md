# PyBer_Analysis
#**PyBer_Challange**
#**Overview of the analysis: 
  ###**Purpose**
        Through this challange we learn mearging DataFrame with the use of code.we retrived desirable data output which we want for the line chart.
          So, the main purpose of this module is just raise the bar of coding incompare to last module challange and checking the ability of student about the coding           through th whole challange.
          
  ##**Results: **
  ###**Use scipy.stats:**
        In the previous challange we use pandas,matplotlib,and Numpy in this challange we also use scipy.stats along with all pandas library. 
  ###**Different new Functions we used through this module:
        ###**Index.name:**
            with the use of this function we give the name of index line in table and also **Delete** the index name Example:df.index.name = None
        ###**pd.to_datetime():**
            with the use of this function we can make the column readable as datetime which is readable as string column.
